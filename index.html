        <p> Hello, my names Joseph. I've been studying Computer Science and Python since 2019. Over the course of the last few years I've applied the skills I've learned in and out of school to work on projects that involve the use of Data Analysis (using functional programming/ OOPs, scraping data such as decoding/encoding XML, HTML or any data type needed to communicate with Python on the web, that includes fetching/updating data + Networked Application Interfaces with Databases.).
        </p>

            <p>    I've used these skills for Web-Application Development to provide resources with familiarity with systems such as SQL, SQLite, DBMS's, PIP, Pygame. I've studied Relational Database's with hands on experience with these Data Sciences and how they interact with each other, this includes familiarity with back & front end languages too since Python can be used for both. I’ve worked with frameworks such as Flask, Django and Beautiful Soup. I’ve also used organizational tools such as Anaconda to make my own Snake Game with Python. I’ve connected API’s to servers using Oracle and Postman, then furthermore edited the geo-data and used google maps to pinpoint locations and make my own form of a GPS tracker too.
            </p>

    <p>    I'd be happy to connect with you and demonstrate to you what I'm capable of. Right now I'm learning C#, so I can build my first low level complex game.
    </p>
        
    <p>    I have 5 certifications in all completed for my first Specialization. I plan to continue more schooling, but I'm open to job offerings or side projects/ Internships in the meantime. I'm happy to show my current level of experience, or the applications I've worked on/ built these past few years. I'm looking forward to getting into the field, whether it be in "back end development", "front end" or something like Dev Ops. You can email me at hdartzy@outlook.com, thanks
    </p>


        <h3> Some Simple Projects I've worked On</h3>
        <ul>
        <li> I've created my own Snake Game with Python/ Py.game,frameworks organizers like Anaconda, using frameworks like Flask, Django and Beautiful Soup as a tool in my packages.</li>
        <li> I've created a Geo-Locater application, that use's Google Maps with Longitude and Latitude to determine the area we are looking for.</li>
        <li> I've also complete the course specification on Coursera called "Python for Everybody", which had mutlple little projects too. In the end I recived a nice certificate that encapsulated 5 courses, much like this course/specialization. </li>

                    <li> I play fetch with Leia mostly because Milo is a lazy bug.</li>
                    <li> Milo's favorite past time is eating snacks and sitting on the porch.</li>
                    <li> Both of my dogs love snuggling under my blanket late at night.</li>

                            <ul>
                                        <li> My favorite song that involves a lot of Bass is Probably a Jaco Pastorius song. When he joined "Weather Report" they just became a power band of amazing musicians.</li>
                                <li> The reason Why I bought a six string bass was because of Thundercat though! His music was so transcendent and unique, especially his album "Where the Giants Roam". That album takes you places, places you want to be.</li>
                                <li>I love playing Bass when it comes to Jazz and Funk. They are the most interactive and just super fun to play. I love all music though, from Classic Rock, to Funk, from Jazz and all the way to Motown, like Marvin Gaye and James Jamerson.</li>
